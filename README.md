## Product Description
The gitGud project aims to reach gamers, or fresh faces in general, who want to find a new multiplayer game to dive into. Users will have the ability to check out some of the hottest games, learn from the pros, and get involved in the community. Never show up to a game without knowing how to play it again and gitGud.  


## How to Use the Project
After being prompted for basic preliminary information, the user will be presented with a list of games to choose from, populated from the open api "free2game".  Some genre examples include Battle Royale, MOBA and Strategy. After the user makes a game selection, they willl be shown a quick blurb about the title and the top 5 current Twitch streamers in order to watch and learn. The user can then navigate to another game quickly with the form still available and the top 10 games listed if they dont like what they see.
